# Changelog

All notable changes to the ReAcTree Rails Dev plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.9.1] - 2025-01-12

### Fixed
- **Interactive Rules Setup**: `/reactree-init` now properly copies rules to projects
  - Previously, rules were only copied if `.claude/rules/` was completely empty
  - Users who ran init before rules existed in plugin never got rules
  - Inconsistent with skills setup behavior

### Enhanced
- **Phase 2.6 Rules Setup** in `/reactree-init` command:
  - Added interactive questions (similar to skills setup)
  - Users can now choose from 3 strategies:
    1. **Replace all** - Overwrites with latest 15 bundled rules
    2. **Core only** - Copies 3 essential rules (models, controllers, components)
    3. **Merge** - Adds missing rules while preserving existing ones
  - **Case A** (existing rules): Replace all / Keep existing / Merge
  - **Case B** (no rules): Copy all (15 rules) / Core only (3 rules) / Skip

### Improved
- **Rules Documentation Display**:
  - Shows all 15 file path mappings
  - Categories: Rails (6), Frontend (2), Testing (3), Database (1), Quality Gates (3)
  - Clear benefits explanation (60-70% context reduction, hyper-targeted guidance)
  - Works alongside existing skills system

### Documentation
- Enhanced rules system explanation in init command
- Added detailed path-specific rule loading documentation
- Consistent UX between skills and rules setup

## [2.8.5] - 2025-01-05

### Fixed
- Version consistency in discover-skills.sh (updated from 2.5.0 to 2.8.5)

### Added - Guardian Validation Cycle
- **🛡️ Guardian Validation Cycle**: Automatic type safety validation after Phase 4 implementation
- Iterative fix-validate cycle (max 3 iterations) with Sorbet
- Blocks progression if type errors remain unresolved
- Auto-logs violations to `.claude/guardian-fixes.log`
- Graceful degradation if Sorbet not available

### Added - Code Quality Gates
- **🔍 Comprehensive Quality Gates**: Solargraph, Sorbet, and Rubocop integration
- LSP diagnostics via cclsp MCP (undefined methods, constants)
- Static type checking with gradual adoption (`# typed: false/true/strict`)
- Style enforcement with auto-fix suggestions
- Blocking validation: Exit 1 prevents progress until violations fixed
- Phase 4 integration: Validates after each implementation layer

### Added - Requirements Translation
- **📋 Requirements Translation**: User story extraction with "As a... I want... So that..." format
- Automatic acceptance criteria parsing: Given/When/Then BDD format

### Added - Real-time Validation Hooks
- **🔗 Real-time Validation Hooks**: PreToolUse and PostToolUse validation
- PreToolUse: Syntax validation **before** edits (prevents breaking changes)
- PostToolUse: Immediate feedback **after** writes (syntax, rubocop, sorbet)
- File-specific: Only validates Ruby files (`*.rb`)
- Non-blocking: Post-write validation informs but doesn't block

- `requirements-engineering`: User story format detection and task breakdown strategies

### Added - Workflow Enhancements

- Skill discovery and config initialization

### Added - Utility Agents
- `file-finder` (haiku): Fast file discovery by pattern/name

## [2.0.0] - 2024-09-XX

### Added - FEEDBACK Edges
- **FEEDBACK edges**: Backwards communication for self-correcting workflows
- 4 feedback types: FIX_REQUEST, CONTEXT_REQUEST, DEPENDENCY_MISSING, ARCHITECTURE_ISSUE
- `feedback-coordinator` agent routes feedback and manages fix-verify cycles
- Loop prevention: max 2 rounds per pair, max depth 3, cycle detection
- Automatic parent re-execution and child verification
- Complete audit trail in `.claude/reactree-feedback.jsonl`

### Added - TestOracle Agent

- Test pyramid validation (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% system)
- Coverage analysis with 85% threshold enforcement
- Test quality validation (no pending, assertions, uses factories)
- Red-green-refactor orchestration using LOOP control flow
- Test-first mode via --test-first flag or TEST_FIRST_MODE=enabled
