# reactree-rails-dev

ReAcTree-based hierarchical agent orchestration for Ruby on Rails development.

## Overview

This plugin implements research from ["ReAcTree: Hierarchical LLM Agent Trees with Control Flow for Long-Horizon Task Planning"](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.02424v1) to provide intelligent, adaptive Rails development workflows.

**Key Research Finding**: ReAcTree achieved **61% success rate vs 31% for monolithic approaches** (97% improvement) on long-horizon planning tasks through hierarchical decomposition with control flow nodes and dual memory systems.

## Key Features

### 🚀 30-50% Faster Execution
- **Parallel execution** of independent phases (Services + Components + Tests run concurrently)
- **Intelligent dependency analysis** identifies parallelization opportunities
- **Time savings**: ~40 minutes on medium features (125min → 85min)

### 🧠 Intelligent Memory Systems

**Working Memory**:
- Eliminates redundant codebase analysis (no repeated `rg/grep` calls)
- Shares verified facts across all agents (auth helpers, route prefixes, patterns)
- 100% consistency (all agents use identical verified facts)

**Episodic Memory**:
- Learns from successful executions
- Reuses proven approaches for similar tasks
- 15-30% faster on repeat similar features

### 💪 Resilient Workflows
- **Fallback patterns** handle transient failures gracefully
- Workflows don't fail on network issues or missing resources
- Graceful degradation to best available option

## What's New in v2.8.0

### 🛡️ Guardian Validation Cycle
- **Automatic type safety validation** after Phase 4 implementation
- **Iterative fix-validate cycle** (max 3 iterations) with Sorbet
- **Blocks progression** if type errors remain unresolved
- **Auto-logs violations** to `.claude/guardian-fixes.log`
- **Graceful degradation** if Sorbet not available

### 🔍 Comprehensive Quality Gates
- **Solargraph**: LSP diagnostics via cclsp MCP (undefined methods, constants)
- **Sorbet**: Static type checking with gradual adoption (`# typed: false/true/strict`)
- **Rubocop**: Style enforcement with auto-fix suggestions
- **Blocking validation**: Exit 1 prevents progress until violations fixed
- **Phase 4 integration**: Validates after each implementation layer

### 📋 Requirements Translation
- **User story extraction**: "As a... I want... So that..." format
- **Automatic acceptance criteria parsing**: Given/When/Then BDD format
- **Component detection**: Identifies technical components from prompts
- **Beads task breakdown**: Auto-creates epic and subtasks
- **Smart routing**: Routes to appropriate workflow based on intent

### 🔗 Real-time Validation Hooks
- **PreToolUse**: Syntax validation **before** edits (prevents breaking changes)
- **PostToolUse**: Immediate feedback **after** writes (syntax, rubocop, sorbet)
- **File-specific**: Only validates Ruby files (`*.rb`)
- **Non-blocking**: Post-write validation informs but doesn't block

### ⚙️ Configuration

Create `.claude/reactree-rails-dev.local.md`:

```yaml
---
enabled: true
quality_gates_enabled: true
guardian_enabled: true
validation_level: blocking  # blocking, warning, advisory
test_coverage_threshold: 90
smart_detection_enabled: true
detection_mode: suggest
use_claude_analysis: true
requirements_extraction_enabled: true
auto_create_beads_tasks: true
guardian_max_iterations: 3
---
```

**Validation Levels**:
- `blocking`: Exit 1 - prevent commits/edits with violations (default)
- `warning`: Exit 2 - alert but allow with violations
- `advisory`: Exit 0 - display results only

### 📚 New Skills

**code-quality-gates** (`skills/code-quality-gates/`):
- Comprehensive guide to Solargraph, Sorbet, and Rubocop
- Integration patterns for quality gates
- Auto-fix strategies and troubleshooting

**requirements-engineering** (`skills/requirements-engineering/`):
- User story format detection and extraction
- Task breakdown strategies
- Beads integration patterns
- Intent classification algorithms

### 🚀 Workflow Enhancements

**Phase 4.7: Guardian Validation Cycle** (new phase):
- Runs automatically after Phase 4 implementation
- Comprehensive Sorbet type checking on all modified files
- Iterative fix-validate workflow
- Blocks feature until type safety confirmed

**Enhanced Phase 4 Quality Gates**:
- Calls `validate-implementation.sh` after each layer
- Validates with Solargraph, Sorbet, and Rubocop
- Exit codes control workflow progression

### 🎯 Usage Example

```bash
# 1. User provides natural language requirement
User: "As a developer I want JWT authentication with refresh tokens so that users can securely log in"

# 2. Smart detection extracts requirements
📝 User story detected, extracting requirements...
✅ Requirements extracted to .claude/extracted-requirements.md

# 3. Beads tasks auto-created (if enabled)
📋 Creating beads tasks from requirements...
✅ Created epic: AUTH-001
  ✅ Created task: AUTH-002 - Add User authentication columns
  ✅ Created task: AUTH-003 - Implement JWT token generation
  ✅ Created task: AUTH-004 - Create AuthService for login/refresh
  ✅ Created task: AUTH-005 - Add login endpoint
  ✅ Created task: AUTH-006 - Add RSpec tests
🎯 Epic AUTH-001 created with subtasks

# 4. Run workflow
/reactree-dev

# 5. Quality gates validate each layer
🔍 Phase Models Quality Gate
✅ Solargraph validation passed
✅ Sorbet type checking passed
✅ Rubocop validation passed
✅ All validations passed

# 6. Guardian validates after implementation
🛡️  Guardian Validation Cycle
✅ Guardian validation passed - type safety confirmed
Type-safe code ready for review.
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** (>=1.0.0)
- **Ruby on Rails project** (Rails 6.x, 7.x, or 8.x)
- **Beads issue tracker** (`bd` CLI) - Optional but recommended

### Quick Install

```bash
# In your Rails project root
mkdir -p .claude/plugins
cp -r /path/to/reactree-rails-dev .claude/plugins/

# Or clone directly
git clone https://github.com/kaakati/rails-enterprise-dev.git /tmp/rails-enterprise-dev
cp -r /tmp/rails-enterprise-dev/plugins/reactree-rails-dev .claude/plugins/
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
ls .claude/plugins/reactree-rails-dev/
# Should show: agents/ commands/ skills/ hooks/ README.md
```

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Initialize the Plugin

Run the initialization command in Claude Code:

```
/reactree-init
```

This command performs 5 phases:

#### Phase 1: Validate Plugin Installation
- Checks plugin is correctly installed
- Verifies `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable
- Confirms hooks are configured

#### Phase 2: Set Up Skills Directory
- Checks if `.claude/skills/` exists
- **If missing**: Offers to copy 17 bundled skills to your project
- **If exists**: Lists discovered skills by category

#### Phase 3: Create Configuration
Creates `.claude/reactree-rails-dev.local.md` with:
```yaml
---
enabled: true
quality_gates_enabled: true
test_coverage_threshold: 90
auto_commit: false
smart_detection_enabled: true
detection_mode: suggest
use_claude_analysis: true
---
```

#### Phase 4: Initialize Memory Files
Creates 4 memory files in `.claude/`:
- `reactree-memory.jsonl` - Working memory (shared facts)
- `reactree-episodes.jsonl` - Episodic memory (successful patterns)
- `reactree-feedback.jsonl` - FEEDBACK edge state
- `reactree-state.jsonl` - Control flow state (LOOP/CONDITIONAL)

#### Phase 5: Status Report

## Usage

### Command 1: `/reactree-dev` (Green)

**Primary development workflow** for building new features with parallel execution.

#### Trigger Words
```
add, implement, build, create, develop, integrate, set up, configure
```

#### Examples
```bash
# Authentication
/reactree-dev add JWT authentication with refresh tokens
/reactree-dev implement OAuth2 login with Google

# APIs
/reactree-dev create REST API for user management
/reactree-dev build webhook receiver for Stripe events

# Real-time
/reactree-dev add real-time notifications with Action Cable
/reactree-dev implement live chat feature

# Background Jobs
/reactree-dev implement Sidekiq job for report generation

# UI
/reactree-dev add Hotwire-powered search with autocomplete
/reactree-dev create ViewComponent for user card

# Data
/reactree-dev add Order model with polymorphic associations
/reactree-dev create migration for multi-tenant schema
```

#### What Happens
1. **Phase 0: Setup** - Discovers skills, initializes working memory
2. **Phase 2: Inspection** - Analyzes codebase patterns with `codebase-inspector`
3. **Phase 3: Planning** - Creates parallel execution plan with `rails-planner`
4. **Phase 3.5: Context Compilation** - Extracts interfaces with `context-compiler` (if cclsp available)
5. **Phase 4: Implementation** - Generates code with `implementation-executor` + Guardian validation
6. **Phase 5: Review** - Validates with `test-oracle`
7. **Phase 6: Completion** - Records to episodic memory

---

### Command 2: `/reactree-feature` (Cyan)

**Feature-driven development** with user stories, acceptance criteria, and TDD emphasis.

#### Trigger Words
```
user story, as a user, feature, user can, customers should, acceptance criteria
```

#### Examples
```bash
# User Story Format
/reactree-feature As a user I can export my tasks to CSV
/reactree-feature As an admin I can view user activity logs
/reactree-feature Users should be able to reset their password via email

# Feature Requests
/reactree-feature Add export functionality for reports
/reactree-feature Implement bulk import from spreadsheet
/reactree-feature Build real-time dashboard with live metrics

# UI Features
/reactree-feature Add drag-and-drop task reordering
/reactree-feature Create interactive chart for sales data

# Domain Features
/reactree-feature Add multi-tenant support with subdomain routing
/reactree-feature Implement Arabic RTL language support
/reactree-feature Create role-based access control system
```

#### What Happens
1. **Feature Definition** - Parses user story, generates acceptance criteria
2. **TDD Planning** - Designs tests BEFORE implementation
3. **Implementation** - Builds feature to pass acceptance tests
4. **Validation** - Verifies ALL acceptance criteria met

---

### Command 3: `/reactree-debug` (Orange)

**Systematic debugging** with log analysis, root cause identification, and regression prevention.

#### Trigger Words
```
fix, debug, error, bug, issue, broken, not working, failing, crash, exception
```

#### Examples
```bash
# Error Messages
/reactree-debug NoMethodError in TasksController#index
/reactree-debug ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments
/reactree-debug ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound in UsersController#show

# Symptoms
/reactree-debug Users can't login after password reset
/reactree-debug Page loads but data is missing
/reactree-debug Button click does nothing

# Performance
/reactree-debug Slow query on bundles index page
/reactree-debug Request timeout on dashboard load
/reactree-debug N+1 query detected in reports

# Integration
/reactree-debug API returns 500 for valid request
/reactree-debug Sidekiq job keeps failing with retry
```

#### What Happens
1. **Error Capture** - Reproduces error, captures stack trace
2. **Investigation** - Uses `log-analyzer` and `codebase-inspector`
3. **Root Cause** - Uses `code-line-finder` for precise location
4. **Fix Planning** - Designs minimal fix
5. **Implementation** - Applies fix with FEEDBACK edges
6. **Regression Test** - Adds test to prevent recurrence
7. **Verification** - Confirms fix, runs full suite

---

### Command 4: `/reactree-refactor` (Yellow)

**Safe refactoring** with test preservation, reference tracking, and automatic rollback.

#### Trigger Words
```
refactor, rename, move, extract, inline, reorganize, clean up, improve
```

#### Examples
```bash
# Extract
/reactree-refactor PaymentService extract method for charge logic
/reactree-refactor OrdersController extract service object

# Rename
/reactree-refactor User model rename email_address to email
/reactree-refactor rename calculate_total to compute_order_total

# Move
/reactree-refactor OrdersController move business logic to service
/reactree-refactor move helper methods to concern

# Inline
/reactree-refactor legacy_helper.rb inline and delete
/reactree-refactor inline unused private method

# Pattern Changes
/reactree-refactor replace conditional with polymorphism in PaymentProcessor
```

#### What Happens
1. **Pre-Flight** - Runs tests, must be GREEN
2. **Reference Discovery** - Uses `code-line-finder` to find ALL usages
3. **Safe Transformation** - Incremental changes with tests after each
4. **Verification** - Coverage not degraded, all tests pass
5. **Completion** - Detailed commit message

---

### Auto-Triggering (Smart Detection)

Once initialized, the plugin automatically suggests workflows based on your prompts:

| Your Prompt | Suggested Workflow |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Add user authentication" | `/reactree-dev` |
| "As a user I can export..." | `/reactree-feature` |
| "Fix the login bug" | `/reactree-debug` |
| "Refactor the user service" | `/reactree-refactor` |
| "Find the payment controller" | `file-finder` agent |

#### Configuration
In `.claude/reactree-rails-dev.local.md`:
```yaml
smart_detection_enabled: true   # Enable/disable auto-detection
detection_mode: suggest         # suggest | inject | disabled
annoyance_threshold: medium     # low | medium | high
use_claude_analysis: true       # Use Claude CLI for intelligent intent analysis
```

## Architecture

### Control Flow Nodes

**Sequence** (dependencies exist):
```
Database → Models → Services → Controllers
```

**Parallel** (independent work):
```
After Models Complete:
  ├── Services (uses models) ┐
  ├── Components (uses models) ├ Run concurrently!
  └── Model Tests (tests models) ┘
```

**Fallback** (resilience):
```
Fetch TailAdmin patterns:
  Primary: GitHub repo
  ↓ (if fails)
  Fallback1: Local cache
  ↓ (if fails)
  Fallback2: Generic Tailwind
  ↓ (if fails)
  Fallback3: Warn + Use plain HTML
```

**LOOP** (iterative refinement - NEW in v1.1):
```
TDD Cycle (max 3 iterations):
  LOOP until tests pass:
    1. Run RSpec tests
    2. IF failing → Fix code
    3. IF passing → Break

Iteration 1: 5 tests, 2 failures → Fix
Iteration 2: 5 tests, 0 failures → DONE ✓
```

**CONDITIONAL** (branching - NEW in v1.1):
```
IF integration tests pass:
  THEN: Deploy to staging
  ELSE: Debug failures

Result: Tests passing → Deployed ✓
```

### Memory Systems

**Working Memory** (`.claude/reactree-memory.jsonl`):
```json
{
  "key": "admin.current_user",
  "value": {"name": "current_administrator", "file": "..."},
  "agent": "codebase-inspector"
}
```

**Episodic Memory** (`.claude/reactree-episodes.jsonl`):
```json
{
  "subgoal": "stripe_payment_integration",
  "patterns_applied": ["Callable service", "Retry logic"],
  "learnings": ["Webhooks need idempotency keys"]
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Time Savings (Medium Feature)

**Traditional Sequential Workflow**:
```
Database:    10 min
Models:      15 min
Services:    20 min ← waiting
Components:  25 min ← waiting
Jobs:        10 min ← waiting
Controllers: 15 min ← waiting
Views:       10 min ← waiting
Tests:       20 min ← waiting
──────────────────
TOTAL:      125 min
```

**ReAcTree Parallel Workflow**:
```
Group 0: Database         10 min
Group 1: Models           15 min
Group 2 (PARALLEL):       25 min (max of Services:20, Components:25, Tests:15)
Group 3 (PARALLEL):       15 min (max of Jobs:10, Controllers:15)
Group 4: Views            10 min
Group 5: Integration      20 min
──────────────────────────
TOTAL:                    85 min
SAVED:                    40 min (32% faster)
```

### Memory Efficiency

**Without Working Memory** (current):
- Context verification: 5-8 `rg/grep` operations × 4 agents = 20-32 operations
- Time: ~3-5 minutes wasted on redundant analysis

**With Working Memory** (ReAcTree):
- Context verification: 5-8 operations × 1 agent (inspector) = 5-8 operations
- Time: ~30 seconds (cached reads for other agents)
- **Savings**: 2.5-4.5 minutes per workflow

## Requirements

### Skills (Reused from rails-enterprise-dev)

This plugin **reuses existing Rails skills** - no duplication needed:

- `activerecord-patterns` - Database and model conventions
- `service-object-patterns` - Business logic patterns
- `hotwire-patterns` - Turbo/Stimulus patterns
- `rspec-testing-patterns` - Testing strategies
- `rails-conventions` - Rails best practices
- `rails-error-prevention` - Common mistake prevention

### Beads Issue Tracker

Uses `bd` CLI for task tracking:
```bash
# Install beads
npm install -g @beads/cli

# Initialize in project
bd init
```

## Rules System

### Overview

The Rules system provides **path-specific, context-aware guidance** that automatically loads based on the file you're editing. This dramatically reduces context overhead while improving relevance.

**Key Benefits**:
- ✅ **60-70% reduction in context overhead** - Only relevant rules load
- ✅ **Hyper-targeted guidance** - Rules specific to file type (models vs controllers vs tests)
- ✅ **Automatic activation** - No manual selection needed
- ✅ **Project customizable** - Override or extend rules per project
- ✅ **Works with skills** - Complementary to existing skills system

### How It Works

Rules use glob patterns in YAML frontmatter to match file paths:

```markdown
---
paths: app/models/**/*.rb
---

# Model Rules

Your model-specific guidance here...
```

When you edit `app/models/user.rb`, the model rules automatically load. When you edit `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`, controller rules load instead.

### Bundled Rules

The plugin includes 13+ production-ready rule files:

#### Rails Layer Rules (`rules/rails/`)
- **models.md** (`app/models/**/*.rb`)
  - Integer enum patterns (CRITICAL: array syntax, ordering rules)
  - Association patterns (belongs_to, has_many, dependent options)
  - Validation patterns (presence, uniqueness, custom)
  - Callback patterns (after_create_commit, before_validation)

- **controllers.md** (`app/controllers/**/*.rb`)
  - RESTful action patterns (index, show, create, update, destroy)
  - Strong parameters (permit, require)
  - Before actions and filters
  - Response formats (JSON, HTML, Turbo Stream)

- **services.md** (`{app/services,lib/services}/**/*.rb`)
  - Service object structure (initialize, call, Result pattern)
  - Dependency injection patterns
  - Idempotency and retry logic
  - Error handling and recovery

- **jobs.md** (`app/jobs/**/*.rb`)
  - Sidekiq job patterns (queue_as, retry_on, discard_on)
  - Idempotent job design
  - Small payload patterns (pass IDs, not objects)
  - Error handling and dead queues

- **mailers.md** (`app/mailers/**/*.rb`)
  - Action Mailer patterns (mail, default, attachments)

  - Broadcasting patterns (persist first, broadcast second)
  - Presence tracking and client actions

#### Frontend Rules (`rules/frontend/`)
- **components.md** (`app/components/**/*.rb`)
  - ViewComponent delegation patterns (CRITICAL: use delegate, never expose @service)
  - Template requirements (every component needs .html.erb)
  - Slot patterns
  - Testing patterns

- **stimulus.md** (`app/javascript/**/*_controller.js`)
  - Controller naming conventions
  - Target and value patterns
  - Action patterns
  - Lifecycle callbacks (connect, disconnect)

  - shoulda-matchers patterns (associations, validations)
  - Enum testing
  - Scope testing
  - Callback testing

- **request-specs.md** (`spec/requests/**/*_spec.rb`)
  - Request spec structure (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
  - Authentication testing
  - Authorization testing (account scoping)
  - Response assertions

- **system-specs.md** (`spec/system/**/*_spec.rb`)
  - Capybara patterns (visit, fill_in, click_button)
  - JavaScript testing (driven_by :selenium_chrome_headless)
  - User flow testing
  - Assertion patterns

#### Database Rules (`rules/database/`)
- **migrations.md** (`db/migrate/**/*.rb`)
  - Reversible migrations (change vs up/down)
  - Index patterns (ALWAYS index foreign keys)
  - Concurrent indexes (algorithm: :concurrently)
  - Data migrations vs schema migrations

#### Quality Gates (`rules/quality-gates/`)
- **security.md** (`**/*.rb`)
  - SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
  - Mass assignment protection (strong parameters)
  - XSS prevention (sanitize, never html_safe on user input)
  - Authentication patterns (Devise, has_secure_password)
  - Authorization patterns (scope queries to current_user)

- **performance.md** (`**/*.rb`)
  - N+1 query prevention (includes, eager_load)
  - Database indexing (foreign keys, frequently queried columns)
  - Caching strategies (fragment, Russian doll, low-level)
  - Background jobs (move slow operations to Sidekiq)
  - Query optimization (select only needed columns, batch processing)

- **accessibility.md** (`{app/components/**/*.{rb,erb},app/views/**/*.erb}`)
  - WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance
  - Keyboard navigation (tabindex, focus management)
  - ARIA attributes (labels, live regions, roles)
  - Color contrast requirements (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI)
  - Form accessibility (label for, error messages, fieldsets)
  - Semantic HTML (header, nav, main, article, aside, footer)

### Rules vs Skills

**Rules** and **Skills** serve different purposes:

| Aspect | Rules | Skills |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Scope** | File-specific | Agent/workflow-level |
| **Loading** | Automatic (by file path) | Manual (by agent) |
| **Size** | Small (50-500 lines) | Large (500-1500 lines) |
| **Purpose** | Concrete patterns | Orchestration knowledge |
| **Examples** | Enum syntax, controller structure | Workflow patterns, agent coordination |

**When to use Rules**:
- ✅ Layer-specific conventions (models, controllers, services)
- ✅ File-type patterns (specs, migrations, components)
- ✅ Quality gates (security, performance, accessibility)

**When to use Skills**:
- ✅ Cross-cutting concerns (error prevention, codebase inspection)
- ✅ Workflow orchestration (ReAcTree patterns, beads integration)
- ✅ Agent coordination (skill discovery, smart detection)

### Customization

Rules are **project-specific** and can be customized:

#### Override Bundled Rules

Edit files in `.claude/rules/`:
```bash
# Edit model rules for your project
vim .claude/rules/rails/models.md
```

Changes only affect the current project.

#### Add Custom Rules

Create new rule files:
```bash
# Add custom API rules
cat > .claude/rules/api-design.md <<'EOF'
---
paths: app/controllers/api/**/*.rb
---

# API Design Patterns

Your custom API patterns here...
EOF
```

#### Disable Specific Rules

Remove unwanted rule files:
```bash
# Don't need accessibility rules
rm .claude/rules/quality-gates/accessibility.md
```

### Initialization

Rules are automatically initialized by `/reactree-init`:

```bash
# Initialize plugin (includes rules setup)
/reactree-init
```

This creates `.claude/rules/` and copies bundled rules from the plugin.

**Manual setup** (if needed):
```bash
# Create rules directory
mkdir -p .claude/rules

# Copy bundled rules from plugin
cp -r ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/* .claude/rules/
```

### Glob Pattern Examples

Rules use glob patterns to match file paths:

```yaml
# Single directory
paths: app/models/**/*.rb

# Multiple patterns
paths: "{app/services,lib/services}/**/*.rb"

# Specific file types
paths: "app/components/**/*.{rb,erb}"

# All Ruby files (quality gates)
paths: "**/*.rb"

# All views and components (accessibility)
paths: "{app/components/**/*.{rb,erb},app/views/**/*.erb}"
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep rules focused** - One concern per file (models, controllers, etc.)
2. **Use concrete examples** - Show good and bad patterns with code
3. **Document critical patterns** - Mark CRITICAL for must-follow rules
4. **Update as needed** - Rules evolve with your project
5. **Test in isolation** - Verify rules load for specific file types

## Configuration

### Custom Skill Directory

If your skills are in a custom location:

```bash
export CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR="/path/to/custom/skills"
```

### Memory File Locations

Default locations (created automatically):
- Working memory: `.claude/reactree-memory.jsonl`
- Episodic memory: `.claude/reactree-episodes.jsonl`

## Troubleshooting

### "Skills not found" Error

**Cause**: Plugin can't find Rails skills

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure skills exist
ls .claude/skills/

# If using rails-enterprise-dev, copy skills
cp -r /path/to/rails-enterprise-dev/skills/* .claude/skills/
```

### Memory File Corruption

**Cause**: Malformed JSON in memory file

**Solution**:
```bash
# Backup current memory
cp .claude/reactree-memory.jsonl .claude/reactree-memory.jsonl.backup

# Validate and clean
cat .claude/reactree-memory.jsonl | jq . > .claude/reactree-memory-clean.jsonl
mv .claude/reactree-memory-clean.jsonl .claude/reactree-memory.jsonl
```

### Parallel Execution Not Working

**Note**: True parallel execution depends on Claude Code support. Currently tracks phases as "parallel groups" for infrastructure readiness.

**Workaround**: Sequential execution with parallel tracking (still faster due to working memory)

## Changelog

### v2.7.0 (2026-01-01) - Context Compilation & Guardian Validation

**New Phase**:
- ✨ **Phase 3.5: Context Compilation** - LSP-powered context extraction (conditional):
  - Uses cclsp MCP tools (Solargraph) for interface extraction
  - Integrates Sorbet for static type checking
  - Per-task vocabulary building from project symbols
  - Graceful degradation when tools unavailable
  - Runs automatically after Planning, before Implementation

**New Agent**:
- ✨ **context-compiler** (haiku, cyan) - Extracts interfaces using cclsp:
  - `mcp__cclsp__find_definition` for symbol lookup
  - `mcp__cclsp__find_references` for usage discovery
  - `mcp__cclsp__get_diagnostics` for error detection
  - Vocabulary building from models, services, patterns
  - Stores compiled context in working memory for implementation-executor

**Guardian Validation Cycle**:
- ✨ **Generate-Validate-Execute-Verify cycle** in implementation-executor:
  - **GENERATE**: Write code based on compiled context
  - **VALIDATE**: cclsp diagnostics + Sorbet type checking (Guardian)
  - **EXECUTE**: Run tests
  - **VERIFY**: Final validation
- ✨ **Automatic fix cycles** when Guardian finds errors (max 3 attempts)
- ✨ **Step 0.5: Load Compiled Context** - Reads cclsp-compiled interfaces/vocabulary
- ✨ **Step 3.55: Guardian Validation** - Full validation before test execution

**Tool Stack**:
| Tool | Purpose | Integration |
|------|---------|-------------|
| cclsp MCP | LSP bridge for Claude Code | `mcp__cclsp__*` tools |
| Solargraph | Ruby language server | Via cclsp |
| Sorbet | Static type checking | Via `srb tc` command |
| parser gem | AST analysis | Optional enhancement |
| ripper | Built-in Ruby parser | Fallback |

**Init Enhancements**:
- ✨ **Phase 2.5: Ruby Analysis Tools Setup** in `/reactree-init`:
  - Checks for Solargraph, Sorbet, parser gem availability
  - Interactive installation prompts (all tools, Solargraph only, or skip)
  - Auto-creates `.solargraph.yml` configuration
  - Auto-creates `.claude/cclsp.json` for LSP integration
  - Offers Sorbet initialization (`srb init`) for typed projects
  - Displays final tool availability status

**New Skill**:
- ✨ **context-compilation** (~500 lines) - cclsp + Sorbet integration patterns:
  - Tool Stack Overview (Solargraph, Sorbet, parser, ripper)
  - cclsp Tool Reference (all available MCP tools)
  - Interface Extraction Patterns (classes, methods, modules)
  - Vocabulary Building Patterns (models, services, patterns)
  - Guardian Validation Patterns (diagnostics + type checking)
  - Sorbet Integration (type sigils, signatures, annotations)
  - Graceful Degradation (fallback to grep when tools unavailable)

**Working Memory Keys**:
| Key | Written By | Read By |
|-----|------------|---------|
| `tools.cclsp` | workflow-orchestrator | All agents |
| `interface.{task}.{symbol}` | context-compiler | implementation-executor |
| `project.vocabulary` | context-compiler | implementation-executor |
| `task.{id}.context` | context-compiler | implementation-executor |
| `guardian.{file}` | implementation-executor | implementation-executor |

**Benefits**:
- Type-safe code generation (LSP + Sorbet validation)
- Reduced runtime errors (catch undefined methods early)
- Consistent naming (vocabulary enforcement)
- Faster implementation (pre-compiled interfaces)
- Automatic fix cycles (Guardian catches errors before tests)
